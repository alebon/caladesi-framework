#Welcome to the Caladesi Framework

The Caladesi Framework is written in Scala and is intended to be used in other Scala projects. It is inspired by the liftweb framework. 
Hence it uses some parts of it (lift-json, ...).

##What you'll find here in future:

caladesi-orientdb,
caladesi-web, and more to come later

###Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.caladesiframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>caladesi-orientdb_${scala.version}</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
